# turtle_crossing

This is a classic **"Turtle Crossing the Road"** game using the Turtle module and Python.

In this game, you are the Turtle. 🐢

You appear on the edge of a street. And just after you appear, so does the traffic.

**Can you cross the street safely?**

You can only move forward. (Use the ⬆️ key to move.)

If you cross the road safely, you reach the next level: **Same street. Faster traffic.** 🚗

**That's all there is to it!** 🏁 🐢
